```

### Examples


```sh
# Register a machine
API_TOKEN=6afe45ef0b9cd5d99b0a34aff1982aaf ./cleansweep.sh

# Register with machine name `testing`:
FRIENDLY_NAME=testing ./cleansweep.sh

# Store / load configuration from `.config` directory:
CONFIG_DIR=.config ./cleansweep.sh

# Enable verbose output
# This outputs all your installed packages to the console
./cleansweep.sh -v
```

### Options

#### `-v`

Enable verbose output to stderr

### Environment variables

- `API_TOKEN`: The API token to use
- `FRIENDLY_NAME`: Specify a custom name for this machine, `hostname` by default
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Specify an alternative location to store metadata, `.patchwork` by default
