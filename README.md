$ ./cleansweep.sh
```

or


```sh
$ PATCHWORK_API_KEY=your_api_key ./cleansweep.sh
```


### Examples


```sh
# Register a machine
./cleansweep.sh

# Register with machine name `testing`
FRIENDLY_NAME=testing ./cleansweep.sh

# Store / load configuration from `.config` directory
CONFIG_DIR=.config ./cleansweep.sh

# Specify a UUID to use
CLEANSWEEP_UUID=95ff6009-3782-4d13-9968-4f7e8778ab93 ./cleansweep.sh

# Enable verbose output
# This outputs all your installed packages to the console
./cleansweep.sh -v
```

### Options

#### `-v`

Enable verbose output to stderr

### Environment variables

- `PATCHWORK_API_KEY`: The API key to use
- `FRIENDLY_NAME`: Specify a custom name for this machine, `hostname` by default
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Specify an alternative location to store metadata, `.patchwork` by default
- `CLEANSWEEP_UUID`: Specify a UUID to use. The UUID must have been obtained through a previous register call.


### Configuration

The machine uuid is stored in `.patchwork/uuid` by default. You can reset the uuid by deleting that file. This may be required when upgradng the operating system.

You can specify a UUID by setting `CLEANSWEEP_UUID`. UUIDs are specific to Linux versions. You will need a new UUID if you upgrade your version of Linux, e.g. Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04
